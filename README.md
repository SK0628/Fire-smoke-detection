# Fire-smoke-detection
🚀 Successfully Built an AI Model for Fire & Smoke Detection Using Azure Custom Vision!

In today's world, early fire and smoke detection is critical for safety. I recently developed an image recognition model using Azure Custom Vision to classify and detect fire and smoke with high accuracy.

🔹 Project Highlights:
✅ Used Azure Custom Vision for training & deployment
✅ Labeled and trained the model with real-world fire & smoke images
✅ Achieved impressive accuracy in classification
✅ Built an API for seamless integration into applications

🔥 Potential Applications:
✅ Smart surveillance systems
✅ Industrial safety monitoring
✅ IoT-based early warning systems

Excited to share my learnings and looking forward to collaborating with others working on AI-driven safety solutions! 🤝
